!Series_summary	"Here we studied the epigenetic regulation of the naïve CD4+ T-cell activation response among children with IgE-mediated food allergy. Using integrated DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiling, we found that food allergy in infancy is associated with dysregulation of T-cell activation genes. Reduced expression of cell cycle related targets of the E2F and MYC transcription factor networks, and remodeling of DNA methylation at metabolic (RPTOR, PIK3D, MAPK1, FOXO1) and inflammatory genes (IL1R, IL18RAP, CD82) were associated with poorer T-lymphoproliferative responses in infancy after polyclonal activation of the T-cell receptor."
!Series_overall_design	"mRNA sequencing of naïve CD4+ T-cells under two conditions (anti-CD3+CD28 activated, or quiescent) at two ages (baseline (12months) and followup (2 or 4 years)) in allergic and non-allergic children."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
